<h2>Java Script</h2>
<p>JavaScript (English : JavaScript) is an object-based scripting language.
  This language is commonly used within Web browsers and has the ability to
  access embedded objects in other applications. It is also used for programming
  a server-side network, such as a runtime environment such as Node.js.
  The JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of
  Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha and later LiveScript,
  which became JavaScript. Although the syntax of JavaScript is similar to that
  of Javain Micro Systems, it is in fact based on the basic syntax of both languages,
  and Java and JavaScript are not directly related. Other than its name and phrase,
  it is more similar to Self-Nasskim than Java. As of January 2013, the most recent
  version is JavaScript 1.8.5 and is [3]supported by Firefox 3.
  The JavaScript version corresponding to the standard ECMA-262 third edition
  is 1.5. The ECMA script is simply a standardized version of JavaScript.
  Mozilla 1.8 Beta 1 has partially supported the extended language of E4 (ECMA-357),
  which corresponds to XML. Each browser has a different supported version.</p>
